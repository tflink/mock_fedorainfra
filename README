This is a partial implementation of the Fedora infrastructure to use for
testing without needing to actually set up instances of all the services.

The project was initially designed to assist in the testing of AutoQA.

At this point, this is a very QnD project and the code is really ugly. Use at
your own risk and know that everything is likely to change in the not so far
future.

Capabilities:
    - Capturing bodhi comments
    - Proxying bodhi queries
    - Providing fake data for koji queries

Dependencies:
  Flask
  Flask-XML-RPC

To run the tests, run:
  runtests.sh

To start a local http server, run:
  python mock_fedorainfra/boji.py

If you want the http server to be accessible from other machines, add the
public host name to the end of boji.py
 -> app.run(host='your-hostname-here')

To initialize the sqlite database (used to store comments), Start a python
interpreter and type the following
 > import mock_fedorainfra.boji
 > mock_fedorainfra.boji.init_db()


Note that Flask and its dependencies are installed into a virtualenv if you
run the runtests.sh script. After its creation, you can activate the
env_flask virtualenv and run Flask without installing any new packages.
