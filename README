This is a partial implementation of the Fedora infrastructure to use for testing
without needing to actually set up instances of all the services.

The project was initially designed to assist in the testing of AutoQA.

Dependencies:
  Flask
  Flask-XML-RPC

To run the tests, run:
  runtests.sh

To start a local http server, run:
  python mock_fedorainfra/boji.py

Note that Flask and its dependencies are installed into a virtualenv if you run
the runtests.sh script. After its creation, you can activate the env_flask
virtualenv and run Flask without installing any new packages.
